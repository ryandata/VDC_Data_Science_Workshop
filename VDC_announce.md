Welcome to the Virtual Data Collaboratory's **Undergraduate Data Science Workshop**!  We are excited to share an overview of Data Science practices, tools, and career information with you.

## Description

The event will be held over two days:
- Thursday, November 12, 1:00 pm-4:00 pm [Eastern Time]
â€“ Friday, November 13, 9:00 am-12:00 noon [Eastern Time]

The event will be held virtually.  We will e-mail Zoom links to the workshop the day prior to the event (Wednesday, November 11).

For the interactive portion of the workshop, we will be working with some website demos and with Python.

## Setup

You will need a computer with an internet connection, running Zoom software (<https://zoom.us>).  Please ensure that your Zoom setup is working prior to the event (either browser-based or downloadable app).  During breakout sessions, you will use your webcam and microphone to work in teams.

For Python exercises, we will use **Google Colab**, an online Python environment requiring minimal setup.  Make sure that you have activated an account (typically using a Gmail address) at 

 **<http://colab.research.google.com>**
 
 We will be working with **Jupyter notebooks** in Google Colab. The Jupyter notebook format allows text and executable code on the same page, providing the ability to explain and describe code in context.  You may want to familiarize yourself with the Jupyter notebook via Google Colab's introduction at 
 
 **<https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb>**

Here is some more background on Google Colab (optional):
<https://research.google.com/colaboratory/faq.html>

Python can also be run locally via integrated tools like **Anaconda** [<https://anaconda.com>] or directly via the command line using **Python** along [<https://www.python.org>].  You may be familiar with these methods as well, but for a consistent experience, we ask you to use Google Colab for the purposes of the workshop.

Datasets and code will be provided during the workshop.
